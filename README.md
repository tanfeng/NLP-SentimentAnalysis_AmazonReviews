# THIS WAS A DATA SCIENCE PROJECT FOR COURSE DAT 540 at Universitetet i Stavanger
The problem statement is shared in the file **Project proposal - Amazon Sentiment.pdf**

# TITLE: NLP-SentimentAnalysis_AmazonReviews
The best businesses understand the sentiment of their customers — what people are saying, how they’re saying it, and what they mean. Amazon is one of the pioneer companies who gave significant importance to user sentiments. It all started with “Dell Hell” case of laptop manufacturing company Dell. Customer sentiment can be found in tweets, comments, reviews, or other places where people mention your brand. Sentiment Analysis is the domain of understanding these emotions with software, and it’s a must-understand for developers and business leaders in a modern workplace. The aim of this project to detect sentiments of the Amazon users.

# Instruction: 

Use Preprocessor.py only before using ML algorithms (NB, KNN, LDA, SVC, LinearSVC, Random Forest), preprocessing is handled in CNN and LSTM notebooks. The theory and code is explained in the indivdual notebooks. The conclusions drawn from the comparative analysis are also discussed in the notebooks.
